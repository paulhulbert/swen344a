# SWEN-344 Class Project: Team SÃœT

## Configuring the application

copy config.template.js to config.js (can do this in file system too)

```bash
$ cp config.template.js config.js
```

Members of the project can see the firebase values needed by adding this path to the end of your firebase console url `/project/web-engineering-spring-2019/settings/general/`

You can also find these values on the Firebase console in "Project Settings" under the "General" tab

| Config Key  | Description                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| API_KEY     | The property called "Web API Key" in the Firebase settings general tab |
| AUTH_DOMAIN | Your "Project ID" from the Firebase settings general tab appended with ".firebaseapp.com", i.e. `web-engineering-spring-2019.firebaseapp.com` |

You can also pass these values in as environment variables to the Node applicaiton like so

``` bash
# run the project locally
$ API_KEY='<YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>' AUTH_DOMAIN='<YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN_HERE>' npm run start
# ...or build the project
$ API_KEY='<YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>' AUTH_DOMAIN='<YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN_HERE>' npm run build
```
